- Restaurant Input: Input a list of restaurants to consider for a meal
- List Display: See all restaurants the app can choose from.

- Save list: Save and persist restaurant list to local storage in browser.
- Persistent List: Keep list permanent from day to day
- Restaurant Blacklist: Option to exclude selected restaurants until list resets.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, appetizing salmon color (#F08080) evokes a sense of culinary warmth without being overly bold.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated salmon hue (#F8D7D7) provides a soft, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: A light-coral color (#F05A28) highlights interactive elements with a touch of brightness and contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short text snippets; 'Alegreya' (serif) for the display of longer lists or restaurant descriptions.
- Use simple, clean icons related to food and dining, such as cutlery, plates, and location markers.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with ample whitespace for readability. The input field and suggestion display should be prominently placed.
- Subtle transition animations when a restaurant is suggested or when loading a new list.  Consider a spinner animation to give the LLM a feeling of reflection while thinking.
